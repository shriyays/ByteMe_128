# Cervical Cancer Risk Detection Model 


We are all aware of cancer is a deadly disease to treat and hard to diagnose before it is too late. Its nature of recurring after a while is very difficult to cope with. So why not prevent its occurrence as a whole? On researching, we came across information that cervical cancer was one of the most preventable types of cancer and concluded to work on this project. 

Our model helps classifying the risk of cervical cancer based on certain factors which do not require medical testing. In fact a short interrogation of the person who wants to test their health would be enough for the model to predict the risk.

The result of the project can guide the user and inform them of the risk. It is then the users choice to give it immediate attention and visit a hospital for a biopsy.
